Players who have a solid understanding of FPS games with 10-20 hours of FPS gaming time per week (N = 6). Casual FPS players with less than 10 hours of FPS gaming time per week (N = 6). Players who have never or barely played FPS games (N = 6). Total N = 24. Remote participants Players need to team up to play the game, to avoid monotony in teamwork, the main purpose of recruiting remote participants was to diversify the sample pool and mimic a realistic gaming environment.\nPlayers who have FPS gaming experiences to a different extent. Players who were able to commit to at least one play session (i.e., at least one day) Total N = 60 *Such as Call of Duty series, BattleField series，Overwatch 2, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive\nResearch methods The research was conducted longitudinally and aimed to track players’ perspectives on the progression system over a period of 7 consecutive days. The players started the game from the beginning and switched between game modes according to a pre-determined protocol. They played approximately 6 hours a day in the user research lab, accumulating to around 40 hours of total play experience by the end of the test.\nOn the first day, all players were required to complete a pre-test survey. At the end of the first 6 days, on-site participants also completed a survey. On the final day, both on-site and remote players completed an end-of-test survey. The on-site players were divided into 4 groups (i.e., 6 players per group), and focus group were held with each group.\nSurvey All of the surveys were created and distributed through Qualtrics.\nThe pre-test survey was distributed before the players started to play. The survey consisted of a brief presentation of the in-game faction and weapon images and aimed to gather the players’ initial impressions of the general game art style.\nThe end-of-day surveys consisted mostly of identical questions based on the players’ experiences of the day, with slight modifications based on player’s progression from day to day. The primary focus of these surveys was to gather player opinions and insights on the progression system. The end-of-test survey investigated players’ views and thoughts on both the progression system and other key game features.\nThe general framework of the surveys is demonstrated below:\nFocus group The primary objective of conducting focus groups was to gain in-depth opinions about the progression system and overall game experiences. During these focus groups, participants were asked a series of questions, such as:\nDid you intentionally try to complete any main mission? If so, which one posed the greatest challenge for you? Did you feel motivated to complete the main missions? Or did you ever feel the game force you to do so? Did you ever lose track of the missions you had accomplished? If so, at what stage did this occur? Do you prefer passive main missions or active missions? Can you explain why? How satisfied are you with the rewards you received for completing missions? Can you recall a particularly memorable moment from your experience playing the game? Of all the elements of the game, what is your favorite and least favorite aspect? Could you highlight just one point for each? My role User research moderator\nResponsible for: technical set up for the playtest, troubleshooting, conducting focus group, survey data anlysis/visulization, and final report writing.\n","wordCount":"679","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yadan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yadanluo98.github.io/projects/appreciation_test/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yadan
