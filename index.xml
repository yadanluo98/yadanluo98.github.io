      <title>User motivations and behaviors - Tom Clancy&#39;s The Division 2</title>
      <link>https://yadanluo98.github.io/projects/thesis/</link>

      <guid>https://yadanluo98.github.io/projects/thesis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Master Thesis project that I completed at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.massive.se/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Massive Entertainment - A Ubisoft Studio&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-objective&#34;&gt;Research objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychometrics tools (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://quanticfoundry.com/#motivation-model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gamer Motivation Model&lt;/a&gt;
) could tell us why players want to play a certain game, and many studies have proven that player motivation is tightly interwined with players&amp;rsquo; self-reported behaviors. However, it is not very clear that how the motivations are reflected during actual gameplay. This research trageted on players of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-division/the-division-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s The Division 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
, a tactical shooter action role-playing video game selling over 10 million copies worldwide, primarily aimed to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can players’ motivations of playing &lt;em&gt;The Division 2&lt;/em&gt; express in their actual gameplay?&lt;/strong&gt; Or in other words, &lt;strong&gt;find measurable corresponding relationships between gaming motivations and in-game behaviors of The Division 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-methods&#34;&gt;Research methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, survey and telemetry data were utilized to operationalize the two main target variables: player motivation and player behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;survey&#34;&gt;Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1399422/FULLTEXT01.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Ubisoft Perceived Experiences Questionnaire (UPEQ)&lt;/a&gt;
is a psychometric instrument developed by Azadvar &amp;amp; Canossa (2018) under the framework of Self-determination theory (SDT) to measure if the 4 basic psychological needs (&lt;em&gt;Autonomy,Competence, Relatedness, and Presence&lt;/em&gt;) are satisfied through playing video games. It contains 4 subscales and 24 items using 5-Likert scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questionnair is originally in English. Validated by &lt;strong&gt;reliability test&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)&lt;/strong&gt;, the UPEQ was also translated into Chinese before the formal distribution for reaching out to a more diverse sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;telemetry-data&#34;&gt;Telemetry data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregated game metrics below covered most in-game behaviors and could be categorized as 3 types: &lt;em&gt;playtime, progression, and DLC gameplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;game_metrics.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-collection&#34;&gt;Data collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole data collection process was GDPR-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5,000&lt;/strong&gt; random active players across the globe who at least played one time during the month prior to the survey distribution were selected as the sample pool during February, 2022. By tracking their user ids, the UPEQ survey plus several demographic questions were distributed to each player via their registered email through the CRM pipeline. The players were informed that the survey was targered on their play experiences of &lt;em&gt;The Division 2&lt;/em&gt;. The survey was distributed through &lt;em&gt;SurveyMonkey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telemetry data were extarcted through the offical game date bases in April, 2022. The survey responses were linked with the telemetry data by user ids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;269&lt;/strong&gt; players filled the survey, after cleaning outliers/over-consistent responses, &lt;strong&gt;148&lt;/strong&gt; players remianed as the final sample size. The demographic characteristics of the respondents can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9090576&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;strong&gt;35%&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;26%&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;24%&lt;/strong&gt; of the participants were from Europe, and the USA, the mainland of China, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;map.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-analysis&#34;&gt;Data analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical Linear regression models&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;logistic regression models&lt;/strong&gt; were applied to the data set to explore if player motivations were predictive of the in-game behaviors. An example of the R codes is displayed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# self-reported playtime
summary(mod_selftime &amp;lt;- lm(log(Weekly_playtime) ~ Relatedness, data))

# tests to check multicollinearity, normality of the model
shapiro.test(rstandard(mod_selftime))
vif(mod_selftime)
car::durbinWatsonTest(mod_selftime)

# group playtime
summary(mod_gp2 &amp;lt;- lm(playtime_gp ~ Playstyle+Closeness, data))
summary(mod_gp1 &amp;lt;- lm(playtime_gp ~ Closeness, data))
anova(mod_gp1,mod_gp2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-findings&#34;&gt;Key findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For game designers, the research provides an insight into specific associations between motives of player engagement and game mechanics, which could be utilized to strengthen desired in-game behaviors of players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;The Division 2&lt;/em&gt;, the study found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional connections with the game was one of the main drives&lt;/strong&gt;: The more connected players feel with in-game characters, the more time they invested in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immersion could facilitate engagement&lt;/strong&gt;: If players are more immersed in the game, it is more likely for them to level up faster, i.e., be more active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Players purchase more content for challenges&lt;/strong&gt;: Whether players buy season-pass can be significantly predicted by &lt;em&gt;Competence&lt;/em&gt; scores, which means the more players feel effective and capable while playing, the more likely they would purchase DLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Usability Test - An unreleased open-world AAA project</title>
      <link>https://yadanluo98.github.io/projects/usability_test/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yadanluo98.github.io/projects/usability_test/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this project is currently still in the development stage, and as such, only a general outline without specific details of the project/research results is presented at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-objective&#34;&gt;Research objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify usability issues of the general gameplay experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB&lt;/strong&gt;: Game appreciation is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; the aim of the current research since usability playthrough and appreciation playthrough would interfere with each other and harm reliability of the entire study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-insights&#34;&gt;Key insights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorized by game features, usability issues and what specifically caused such usability issues were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prticipant-recruitment-criteria&#34;&gt;Prticipant recruitment criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Casual players (&lt;em&gt;weekly gaming time 11-20 hours&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least played one game of the same genre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar with using Xbox controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N = 8~12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-methods&#34;&gt;Research methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-game characters/progression were set up prior to the playtest so that players did not have to start from the beginning and would be able to experience main features of the game. Players were informed that they could play the game in a way that they preferred (i.e., &lt;em&gt;following main quests is not a must&lt;/em&gt;) for 8 hours. Players were also informed that their gameplay level would not be judged and they should provide feedback as genuine/specific as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oberservation&#34;&gt;Oberservation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming with eye tracking and gamepad input was set up for each player for observation. Players&amp;rsquo; behaviors/expressions could tell us some major friction points regarding usability. In general, observation should cover &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;what happened&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;when/how it happend&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, and sometimes &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;why it happened&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. The observation guideline is demonstrated below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;observation.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ad-hoc-interview&#34;&gt;Ad hoc interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the playtest, players might be intervened and asked to explain what just happened in the game. This was for better understanding &lt;strong&gt;the reasons behind the issues that were observed&lt;/strong&gt;. We could get more reliable answers and avoid false positive (behavior that looks like an issue but is not) by condcuting ad hoc interviews. The interventions were only be performed if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;information is missed regarding the observation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;players showed strong frustration or encountered a walkthrough breaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;players were &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; during a combat or any other intense gameplay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews were semi-structured and the general interview questions are presented as following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you going to do next?/What do you expect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the blocker here? (&lt;em&gt;if any&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you notice the icon/understand that you need to press&amp;hellip;? (&lt;em&gt;if it is related to UI/control&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this affect you to achieve your objective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did you skip &lt;em&gt;a certain activity&lt;/em&gt;? (&lt;em&gt;if any&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-role&#34;&gt;My role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User research moderator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-questions&#34;&gt;Research questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Research Question&lt;/strong&gt;: What do players think of the balance of the progression system* in the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary Research Question&lt;/strong&gt;: How do players evaluate the character design and other main game features?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Progression system: A game mechanics that players need to complete derminated goals to move forward in games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-insights&#34;&gt;Key insights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prticipant-recruitment-criteria&#34;&gt;Prticipant recruitment criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;onsite-participants&#34;&gt;Onsite participants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players who have extensive FPS gaming experiences with i.e., who have played mainstream FPS games* more than &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; hours per week (&lt;em&gt;N = 6&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players who have a solid understanding of FPS games with 10-20 hours of FPS gaming time per week (&lt;em&gt;N = 6&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Casual FPS players with less than 10 hours of FPS gaming time per week (&lt;em&gt;N = 6&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players who have never or barely played FPS games (&lt;em&gt;N = 6&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total N = 24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;remote-participants&#34;&gt;Remote participants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players need to team up to play the game, to avoid monotony in teamwork, the main purpose of recruiting remote participants was to diversify the sample pool and mimic a realistic gaming environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players who have FPS gaming experiences to a different extent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players who were able to commit to at least one play session (i.e., at least one day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total N = 60&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Such as Call of Duty series&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BattleField series&lt;/em&gt;，&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Counter Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-methods&#34;&gt;Research methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted longitudinally and aimed to track players&amp;rsquo; perspectives on the progression system over a period of 7 consecutive days. The players started the game from the beginning and switched between game modes according to a pre-determined protocol. They played approximately 6 hours a day in the user research lab, accumulating to around 40 hours of total play experience by the end of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day, all players were required to complete a pre-test survey. At the end of the first 6 days, on-site participants also completed a survey. On the final day, both on-site and remote players completed an end-of-test survey. The on-site players were divided into 4 groups (i.e., 6 players per group), and focus group were held with each group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;survey&#34;&gt;Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the surveys were created and distributed through &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-test survey was distributed before the players started to play. The survey consisted of a brief presentation of the in-game faction and weapon images and aimed to gather the players&amp;rsquo; initial impressions of the general game art style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end-of-day surveys consisted mostly of identical questions based on the players&amp;rsquo; experiences of the day, with slight modifications based on player&amp;rsquo;s progression from day to day. The primary focus of these surveys was to gather player opinions and insights on the progression system. The end-of-test survey investigated players&amp;rsquo; views and thoughts on both the progression system and other key game features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general framework of the surveys is demonstrated below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;survey.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;focus-group&#34;&gt;Focus group&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of conducting focus groups was to gain in-depth opinions about the progression system and overall game experiences. During these focus groups, participants were asked a series of questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you intentionally try to complete any main mission?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If so, which one posed the greatest challenge for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you feel motivated to complete the main missions?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or did you ever feel the game force you to do so?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you ever lose track of the missions you had accomplished?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If so, at what stage did this occur?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you prefer passive main missions or active missions? Can you explain why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How satisfied are you with the rewards you received for completing missions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you recall a particularly memorable moment from your experience playing the game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of all the elements of the game, what is your favorite and least favorite aspect? Could you highlight just one point for each?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-role&#34;&gt;My role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User research moderator&lt;/p&gt;
